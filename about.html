					<h4> If you adopt, you'll save a life </h4> <br>
					<p> Around 2.7 million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized each year in the United States simply because too many people give up their pets, and too few people adopt from shelters.  Because there is limited space at shelters, staff members sometimes need to make very hard decisions to euthanize animals who haven't been adopted.  </p> <p>The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically if more people adopted pets instead of buying them.  By adopting from a private humane society or animal shelter, rescue group, or the local animal-control agency, you'll help save the lives of two animals—the pet you adopt and a homeless animal somewhere who can be rescued because of space you helped free up.</p>

					<h4> Adopting a pet will make you feel better </h4> <br>
					<p> Pets have a way of putting a smile on your face and a spring in your step. Not only do animals give you unconditional love, but they have been shown to be psychologically, emotionally, and physically beneficial. Caring for a companion animal can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment and lessen feelings of loneliness and isolation in all age groups.</p>
					<p> Pets can help your physical health as well—just spending time with an animal can help lower a persons blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and dog walking, pet grooming, and even petting provide increased physical activity that can help strengthen the heart, improve blood circulation, and slow the loss of bone tissue. Put simply, pets aren't just good friends; they're also good medicine and can improve a person's well-being in many ways. </p>

					<h5> Frankie </h5>
					<p> We adopted Frankie in 2005. She had been abandoned and was found tied to a fence. She was half her normal weight, matted and scared. She looked awful in her Petfinder photo, and we almost passed over her. So glad we took a chance! I named her Frankie after St. Francis. It took a little patience and about six months for her to trust us and her new home. She's such fun, loves her toys, loves us and we feel very grateful to have her.  </p>
